Spent about 6/7 hours trying to figure out how to actual lay it out - to eventually get told - confirms my previous notes when starting a project I really need to talk out how it needs to be set out before I can approach it - I think the bigger issue was the way I was shown in the skeleton was not the way I would have intuatively created it hence the stuglles. In a case like I need to ask as many questions as possible to actually figure out what is going on. As much as I moan the way I wanted to do it initally would not of allowed any scaleability while the method Manny showed allows scalabilty. 

I managed to complete the project - basic image gallery - however it was a slog and missed several goals just happy to get the basics down. 

There are several goals which I will add to throughout the week - like media queries I do not get them and will be reading up massivley on them since functionality across devices is important also another thing to add into the planning process - from now on I need to go with the mobile first technique.

I used every website and resource out there to get there. ----Update 10/09/2024---- Having looked on the apple website I have looked at some interesting code in which where you were zoomed in/ on desktop it has some nice scroll features however when you were on phone/zoomed out they stopped due to media queries. Really interesting however complicated and will be looking into it waaaaaaay more.

Brute forced the starter image because I did not want to go delve back into my JS... ----Update 10/09/2024---- I was going to update the first image so that it comes from my JS however I am repurposing the project into something else so having the first image outside is actually quite useful.

I can also do some more styling to make the Nav bar look nicer. ----Update 10/09/2024---- I have just fixed it to the bottom of the page

----Update 10/09/2024---- Looking back on the code it is relativley simple - I just did not know how to do it - frustrating as it is there are several notes I need to take away.
  - scalability is KEY
  - write everything out first - especially if it is not your idea!!!
  - not possible for this project - but my prefered method of working is little and often - hence why adding to this after submittion.
