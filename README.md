Spent about 6/7 hours trying to figure out how to actual lay it out - to eventually get told - confirms my previous notes when starting a project I really need to talk out how it needs to be set out before I can approach it.
I managed to complete the project - basic image gallery - however it was a slog. There are several goals which I will add to throughout the week. I used every website and resource out there to get there. Brute forced the starter image because I did not want to go delve back into my JS... I can also do some more styling to make the Nav bar look nicer and make it editable for phones etc.
